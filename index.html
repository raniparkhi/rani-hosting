            Bamboos are a diverse group of mostly evergreen perennial flowering plants making up the subfamily Bambusoideae
        of the grass family Poaceae. Giant bamboos are the largest members of the grass family, in the case of
        Dendrocalamus sinicus individual culms reaching a length of 46 meters, up to 36 centimeters in thickness and a
        weight of up to 450 kilograms.[3] The internodes of bamboos can also be of great length. Kinabaluchloa wrayi has
        internodes up to 2.5 meters in length.[4] and Arthrostylidium schombergkii with lower internodes up to 5 meters
        in length,[5] exceeded in length only by Papyrus. By contrast, the culms of the tiny bamboo Raddiella vanessiae
        of the Kaieteur Plateau in French Guiana are only 10–20 millimeters in length by about two millimeters in
        width.[6][7] The origin of the word "bamboo" is uncertain, but it probably comes from the Dutch or Portuguese
        language, which originally borrowed it from Malay or Kannada.[8]

            Currently bamboo has a variety of uses in the world which vary massively based on location.
            In Asia it is used as scaffolding, and almost everything else such as food. In the United States and many 
            European countries it is used more for a clothing material, flooring and bikes. In the bamboo bike industry 
            the company Calfee is known for their extremely high end bikes. They claim that there bamboo frames are
             equally still to frames made out of carbon fiber, while still retaining the vibration dampening effect
              (Calfee). While Calfee makes multi thousand dollar bamboo bikes, they have a sub brand that makes cheaper
               bikes for third world countries. The sub brand that makes the cheaper bikes also will go into third world
                countries and teach the people how to make the bikes themselves. Bamboo is probably used to its full
                 potential most in Asia. In China the large scale building projects all use bamboo for scaffolding rather
                  than metal. This is done because of the abundance of bamboo in most regions of China (Bess). The bamboo
                   is also eaten by the wildlife in China, such as the Pandas, and certain types of bamboo rats. Other 
                   are...
