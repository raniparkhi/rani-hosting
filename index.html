        Bamboos are a diverse group of mostly evergreen perennial flowering plants making up the subfamily Bambusoideae
        of the grass family Poaceae. Giant bamboos are the largest members of the grass family, in the case of
        Dendrocalamus sinicus individual culms reaching a length of 46 meters, up to 36 centimeters in thickness and a
        weight of up to 450 kilograms.[3] The internodes of bamboos can also be of great length. Kinabaluchloa wrayi has
        internodes up to 2.5 meters in length.[4] and Arthrostylidium schombergkii with lower internodes up to 5 meters
        in length,[5] exceeded in length only by Papyrus. By contrast, the culms of the tiny bamboo Raddiella vanessiae
        of the Kaieteur Plateau in French Guiana are only 10–20 millimeters in length by about two millimeters in
        width.[6][7] The origin of the word "bamboo" is uncertain, but it probably comes from the Dutch or Portuguese
        language, which originally borrowed it from Malay or Kannada.[8]

        Bamboo is the green material of the future, or is it? Bamboo is the largest member of the grass family.
         It is one of the fastest growing “woody” plants in the world. There are different types of bamboo, 
         but on of the most used is called the giant bamboo plant. It can grow in most places in the world
          excluding those areas of extreme cold or extreme dryness (Bamboo Grove). It is a very useful material
           for many different animals such as building for humans, or eating for the pandas. It is the main 
           food source for the pandas that live in areas of the world such as Chengdu China. Bamboo is
            very helpful for humans too.

Currently bamboo has a variety of uses in the world which vary massively based on location.
 In Asia it is used as scaffolding, and almost everything else such as food. In the United States and many 
 European countries it is used more for a clothing material, flooring and bikes. In the bamboo bike industry 
 the company Calfee is known for their extremely high end bikes. They claim that there bamboo frames are
  equally still to frames made out of carbon fiber, while still retaining the vibration dampening effect
   (Calfee). While Calfee makes multi thousand dollar bamboo bikes, they have a sub brand that makes cheaper
    bikes for third world countries. The sub brand that makes the cheaper bikes also will go into third world
     countries and teach the people how to make the bikes themselves. Bamboo is probably used to its full
      potential most in Asia. In China the large scale building projects all use bamboo for scaffolding rather
       than metal. This is done because of the abundance of bamboo in most regions of China (Bess). The bamboo
        is also eaten by the wildlife in China, such as the Pandas, and certain types of bamboo rats. Other 
        are...
